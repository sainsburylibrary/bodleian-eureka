# Redirect site for Eureka (Bodleian subdomain)

This repository provides the code for the GitHub Pages hosted site that redirects the [eureka.bodleian.ox.ac.uk](https://eureka.bodleian.ox.ac.uk) subdomain to eureka.sbs.ox.ac.uk. It is also essential to prevent the subdomain takeover of eureka.bodleian.ox.ac.uk. Unless a GitHub repo (this one) is configured with eureka.bodleian.ox.ac.uk as the _Custom domain_, it is possible for the subdomain to be taken over by a third party. Therefore this repo needs to stay online as a public repo with GitHub Pages enabled.
